      **Portfolio overview**

  - content: |
      ## The goal of this term is to make your portfolio website.

      Every assignment & exercise supports that goal

  - content: |
      ## Multiple milestones

      1. Coming soon page — *Today*
      2. Domain purchasing — *Next week*
      3. Paper & interactive wireframes — *Weeks 4–6*
      4. Basic, Javascript-free, version — *Weeks 6–11*
      5. Final version — *End of term*

      *With lots of small filler pieces in between*

      ## Every week will add…

      - Each week will add onto what was completed before
      - Some weeks will provide in class Q&A and work time
      - Some weeks will add new features like SEO, accessibility, video, etc.
      - Some weeks will concentrate on testing

      *Everything is your portfolio*

  - content: |
      ## Make it personal

      - This is your **personal** website—you are not a company
      - Nobody wants to hire a competing company for placement

  - content: |
      ## Have a goal

      - You want to show off what *you* are capable of
      - The more focused your pieces the better
      - Remain honest: if you’re not interest in motion work, don’t show motion pieces

      *Even think about your dream job/company and target them directly!*

  - content: |
      ## Don’t overextend your code skills

      If you’re not confident with code, keep your site simple

      With very little code you can make an amazing site

  - content: |
      ## Fewer & better

      - 5–10 of your absolute best work
      - Even just 3 absolutely stunning case studies

  - content: |
      ## Case studies are best

      The absolute best portfolio websites include case studies for every showcased work. **Case studies are what employers are looking for.**

  - content: |
      ## Employers want to see:

      - the purpose & goal of the project
      - your different ideas *& sketches*
      - your process *& sketches*
      - the steps you took to get to the final version (*& sketches*)
      - feedback and thoughts for the different stages
      - and maybe the final version—but it’s less important

      (As a by-product, you also can prove that you are capable of writing—an extremely important trait for a designer.)

      ## Always be working

      *Every week you should be working on your portfolio—period*

  - content: |
      ## Start now!

      *Think about:*

      - your brand—fun? personal? corporate?
      - what pieces to include?
      - one page? many pages?
      - how many pieces (~5–10)?
      - everything!
