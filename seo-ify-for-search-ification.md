      ## What & why

      Making your website show early in search results helps people find you.

      We need to help search engines understand our content, our search keywords—and write content for human beings.

      **Organizing & categorizing content will really help websites show in search results.**

      2. Use Mill Street Florist’s old website
      3. Work together to improve the SEO for the site
      4. Discuss the solution as a group

      1. Figure out the focus of the website & each page
      2. Determine the top 5 keywords people might search
      3. Massage the keywords for the 3 different pages
      3. Prioritize the keywords for each page from 1–5

      **You will end with 15 prioritized keywords—keywords can (and should) repeat on pages**
