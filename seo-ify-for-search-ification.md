      ## What & why

      Making your website show early in search results helps people find you.

      We need to help search engines understand our content, our search keywords—and write content for human beings.

      **Organizing & categorizing content will really help websites show in search results.**

      ## A. Determine the focus

      1. Figure out the focus of the website & each page
      2. Determine the top 5 keywords people might search
      3. Massage the keywords for the 5 different pages
      3. Prioritize the keywords for each page from 1–5

      **You will end with 25 prioritized keywords—keywords can (and should) repeat on pages**

      3. Improve keywords in the `<h1>`

        - Title
