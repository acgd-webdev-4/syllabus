      ## Describe Algonquin College with a distinct personality

      I’ve chosen Algonquin because we all have an ephemeral understanding and don’t need to research anything that may sway our decisions.
  - content: |
      ## 1. Pick a personified animal

      In your head pick a personified animal that represents what Algonquin either currently is, or what you feel Algonquin should be, or what Algonquin could be: a bubbly tiger, a crotchety dolphin, etc.

      *Keep this secret.*

      ## 2. Describe Algonquin through your spirit animal

      - Why is the college is great & why should I register?
      - Think about word choices: formal vs. slang
      - Think about grammar: sentence length, punctuation
      - Try to convey a personality without getting in the way of understanding
  - content: |
      ## 3. Volunteer to read your description

      The whole class can discuss why that’s a good fit for Algonquin and try to guess your spirit animal.
