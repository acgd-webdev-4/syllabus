      ## Forwarder

      *You have a single custom email alias that just forwards the email to other full, hosted account.*

      **Pros**
      <br>• Cheap
      <br>• Easy to set up

      **Cons**
      <br>• Responding will show your personal email
      <br>• Can only have a single alias, each alias costs more money

    col2: |
      ## Hosted

      *You have full, hosted—and separate—email account with as many aliases as you’d like.*

      **Pros**
      <br>• Responding will show your custom email
      <br>• Have as many email addresses as you want
      <br>• A separate account from your personal email
      <br>• Reusability: moving web hosts or domain registars is simpler

      **Cons**
      <br>• More expensive
      <br>• Harder to set up
